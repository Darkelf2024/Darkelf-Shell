## üîí Privacy & Fingerprint Defenses

- **Persona Engine:** Rotates realistic browser/OS profiles (user agent, platform, languages, hardware, screen, WebGL, etc.).
- **Canvas Fingerprint Quantization:** All canvas exports and getImageData are quantized (Tor-style) for strong anti-canvas fingerprinting.
- **WebGL Spoofing:** WebGL vendor and renderer strings are spoofed, and readPixels are perturbed.
- **Audio, Fonts, Battery, Clipboard, WebRTC, Media, Sensor Defenses:** Blocks or spoofs all popular fingerprinting surfaces.
- **User-Agent & Client-Hints Spoofing:** Adaptive spoofing of both classic and modern browser identification vectors.
- **Strict CSP Meta Injection:** Enforces inline-script and resource policies to minimize XSS and external code execution.

## üïµÔ∏è Tor Integration

- **Native Tor Proxy Management:** Launch, manage, and rotate Tor circuits directly (via `stem` and system Tor).
- **Onion-Optimized Search:** Optionally uses DuckDuckGo's .onion endpoint for private search.
- **Automatic Proxy Routing:** Sets `ALL_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` for full system routing through Tor.
- **Tor Status Overlay:** Visual indicator and control for Tor activation within the browser shell.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Modern PyWebView UI

- **Custom Toolbar Overlay:** Back/forward/reload, Tor status, tracker/ad blocking, zoom, and home.
- **Context Menu:** Right-click menu with copy/paste/select all, "Paste & Go", etc.
- **Trackers Blocked Badge:** Live count and blocking of trackers/ads via heuristic JS rules.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è AI Security & Anti-Phishing

- **Mini AI Security Module:** Detects phishing, malware, and network sniffers via both JS and Python hooks.
- **Panic Mode:** On threat detection, disables JS, locks navigation, clears proxies, and shows a user alert; auto-releases after timeout.
- **Live Scan:** Phishing keywords, malware patterns, and network analysis are performed on each page/request.

---

## üóëÔ∏è Storage & Cookie Hardening

- **Automatic Storage Clearing:** On page load, clears local/session storage, cookies, and indexedDB.
- **Accept-Language/Referer/Origin Stripping:** Removes these headers from outgoing requests.
- **3rd-Party Cookie and IFrame Blocking:** Prevents cross-site tracking via cookies and iframes.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform-Specific Features

- **macOS Native Persona/JS Toggle:** Uses WKWebView APIs for real user agent and script toggling at the engine level.
- **Native Zoom/JS Toggle:** For macOS, swaps actual WKWebView instance for true JS enable/disable and zoom.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tab & API Features

- **Simple Tab State Tracking:** In-memory tabs with full navigation history.
- **Open/Switch/Close Tabs:** All core multi-tab functions are supported.
- **Pythonic API:** All browser controls are exposed via Python for automation/scripts.

---

## üöÄ Command-Line Configuration

- **CLI Options:** `--start`, `--tor`, `--tor-proxy` for custom start page or Tor routing.
- **Modern Home Page:** Custom HTML home page with branding, search, and Tor status.
